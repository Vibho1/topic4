    <h3 id="BasicInfo">I am summarizing the first three activites that I completed with my team in the first class of
      SIT-209</h3>

    <hr>

    <p id="Head1">Activity 1 - IoT Apps</p>

    <p id="Sum1">In this group activity, we were randomly allotted a 6 member team and we had to answer 3 questions
      related to IoT Apps. First
      we described what is an IoT Application, we mentioned 3 points explaining this term. Basically, IoT Application
      exchanges data with other devices
      over internet and other communication networks. Secondly, we covered some of the essential features of an Iot App
      , some of which are Securtiy, Scalability,
      Connectivity, etc., We then went on to give examples of sectors in which there is usage of IoT, it includes modern
      day security systems, smart wearables,
      parking systems and many more.</p>

    <p id="Head2">Activity 2 - Smart Building</p>

    <p id="Sum2">In this group activity, we briefly explained about a smart building while answering the 3 questions
      thrown towards us by the faculty.
      We started with explaining the meaning of the term 'Smart', this means Self- monitoring Analysis and reporting
      technology which are made
      intelligent with advanced compute to make our everyday life easy which can include AI and machine learning. We
      explained the basic functionalities of the
      'Smart building' which include having measurement sensors, predictive maintenance, remote controlling features and
      much more. Atlast, light was put on to
      the detailed scenarios of the smart building.
    </p>

    <p id="Head3">Activity 3 - Control Interface</p>

    <p id="Sum3">In this group activity, we gave information on 'Control Interface'. We started by answering that what
      are high level features, these refer to
      those features which are quite complex and require extensive hardware and software. These include features like
      temperature controlling, smart doors,
      convenient UI, etc., there was also a discussion about the parts needed for control interface, some of the
      important parts were IoT sensors and actuators,
      microcontrollers and microprocessors, analytics and database software. The users of the 'Control Interface were
      broadly divided into 2 main categories -
      Registered and Unregistered.

    <p id="Head4"> List of IoT Applications</p>
    <p id="Sub1">Here is the list of IoT Applications that I am aware of-:</p>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>Sun AI(Smart Agriculture)</li>
      <p>Food is an integral part of life without which we cannot survive. However, it is an unfortunate fact that a lot
        of food is wasted in developed countries
        like America while people starve in poorer countries like Chad, Sudan, etc. One way to feed everyone is better
        agricultural practices which can be enhanced
        using IoT. This can be done by first collecting data for a farm such as soil quality, sunlight levels, seed
        type, rainfall density from various sources like
        farm sensors, satellites, local weather stations, etc. and then using this data with Machine Learning and IoT to
        create custom recommendations for each
        farm that will optimize the planting procedure, irrigation levels required, fertilizer amount, etc. All this
        will result in better yield or crops with a
        focus on reducing world hunger in the future. This is done very efficiently by SunCulture, which is an
        initiative by Microsoft AI for Earth.</p>
        <br>

      <li>Tesla Cars(Smart Vehicles)</li>
      <p>Smart vehicles or self-driving cars as they can be called are pretty dependent on IoT. These cars have a lot of
        features that are integrated with each
        other and need to communicate such as the sensors that handle navigation, various antennas, controls for
        speeding or slowing down, etc. Here the Internet
        of Things technology is critical especially in the sense that self-driving cars need to be extremely accurate
        and all the parts need to communicate with
        each other in milliseconds on the road. Tesla Cars are quite popular and working on their self-driving cars.
        Tesla Motor's cars use the latest advancements
        in Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. And they are quite popular as well!!! Tesla Model 3 was
        the most sold plug-in electric car in the
        U.S. in 2018 with a total yearly sales of around 140,000 cars.</p>
        <br>

      <li>Google Home(Smart Home)</li>
      <p>Maybe the most famous application of IoT is in Smart Homes. After all, who hasn’t heard about connecting all
        the home applications like lighting, air
        conditioners, locks, thermostat, etc. into a single system that can be controlled from your smartphone! These
        IoT devices are becoming more and more popular
        these days because they allow you complete freedom to personalize your home as you want. In fact, these IoT
        devices are so popular that every second there are
        127 new devices connected to the internet. Some popular ones that you might have heard have, or even have in
        your home, include Google Home, Amazon Echo Plus,
        Philips Hue Lighting System, etc. There are also all sorts of other inventions that you can install in your home
        including Nest Smoke Alarm and Thermostat,
        Foobot Air Quality Monitor, August Smart Lock, etc.</p>
        <br>

      <li>Green Horizons project(Smart Pollution Control)</li>
      <p>Maybe the most famous application of IoT is in Smart Homes. After all, who hasn’t heard about connecting all
        the home applications like lighting,
        air conditioners, locks, thermostat, etc. into a single system that can be controlled from your smartphone!
        These IoT devices are becoming more and
        more popular these days because they allow you complete freedom to personalize your home as you want. In fact,
        these IoT devices are so popular that every
        second there are 127 new devices connected to the internet. Some popular ones that you might have heard have, or
        even have in your home, include Google Home,
        Amazon Echo Plus, Philips Hue Lighting System, etc. There are also all sorts of other inventions that you can
        install in your home including Nest Smoke Alarm
        and Thermostat, Foobot Air Quality Monitor, August Smart Lock, etc.</p>
        <br>

      <li>Smart Nation Sensor Platform(Smart Cities)</li>
      <p>Cities can be made more efficient so that they require fewer resources and are more energy-efficient. This can
        be done with a combination of sensors in
        different capacities all over the city that can be used for various tasks ranging from managing the traffic,
        controlling handling waste management, creating
        smart buildings, optimizing streetlights, etc. There are many cities in the world that are working on
        incorporating IoT and becoming smarter such as Singapore,
        Geneva, Zurich, Oslo, etc. One example of creating smart cities is the Smart Nation Sensor Platform used by
        Singapore which is believed to be the smartest city
        in the world. This platform integrates various facets of transportation, streetlights, public safety, urban
        planning, etc. using sensors in conjugation with IoT.</p>
